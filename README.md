The Employee Management System (EMS) is a comprehensive Flutter application designed to manage employee data efficiently. This system provides various functionalities:
- Adding Employees: Users can add new employees to the system, providing their details and relevant information.
- Updating and Deleting Employees: Existing employee records can be updated with new information or removed from the system as needed.
- View All Employee List: The system offers a clear view of the complete list of employees, facilitating easy browsing and management.
